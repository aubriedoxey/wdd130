    <h2>Aubrie Doxey</h2>
    <p>I am studying accounting with a cluster in programming, and I love it! 
        I will most likely be going into forensic accounting.</p> 
    <p>I enjoy running and reading and am a huge movie watcher! I am not married 
        nor do I have kids. I am currently a full-time student and a tutor for 
        several accounting classes and a TA for several accounting classes.</p>
    <p>I love that the class sizes at BYU-I are so small. It really allows me to 
        get that one-on-one help. This class is a prequiste for a class I need to 
        take in the Fall, so that is the main reason why I am taking this class. I 
        am excited to learn about everything I take for granted with websites and programming. </p>
    <p>I have been a member my whole life. My favortie quote comes from President Nelson
        and is "The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and 
        everything to do with the focus of our lives!" I love Proverbs 3:5-6 </p>
