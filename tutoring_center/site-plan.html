      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The overall purpose of this website is to improve students' experiences at the tutoring center through helping match 
        students with tutors who have similar teaching styles and personalities. Most students have had some sort of experience at
        the tutoring center here on campus. Because tutoring is free for students, many people take advantage of this wonderful 
        tool. Often tutoring is a great experience full of learning, but there are other times that the experience is not the 
        most positive. This could be due to a tutorâ€™s teaching style that does not blend with how you learn or due to differences 
        in personality that causes the student to not feel comfortable with asking questions. What if you could learn a bit about 
        the potential tutors such as how they like to teach and a bit about their personality? You would then have the knowledge 
        to pick a tutor that matches with you the best! I plan to create a website that gives additional information to students 
        about their potential tutor, so they can create an environment where they learn the best.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is college students specifically ages 18 to 25. They will vary from major to major, but they will include students
        who are willing to put a little more work into their classes to receive the desired grade. This could include people struggling
        to pass the class or could be people who are understanding and just want some more one-on-one review time.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        About the Tutoring Center
      </p>
      <p>
        The tutoring center is a free service provided to all students. There are both online and in person 
        options for tutoring sessions. We are flexible to both the tutor's time as well as the student's time.
        Here at the tutoring center we want the success of the students, so we are willing to work with 
        students to understand old and current homework assignments, review recent topics discussed in class, 
        and study for quizzes and tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        How to Prepare for Your Appointment
      </p>
      <p>
        It is so important to come prepared to your tutoring appointment with specific questions or issues.
        The tutors are students who have previously taken the class and done well. They are not professional
        teachers! If you come and say, "I don't know again thing. Can you help me with everything?" That is 
        very hard to help because it is not specific. Try to identify the most difficult issue, and work on 
        that first. It is also very important that students go to class regularly and take notes. Tutors can 
        only help students as much as they are willing to put forth an effort. It is also important that 
        students make an effort to do the homework on their own before tutoring. Many students just lack 
        confidence, so doing the work on your own can help you gain confidence.
      </p>

        Suggested Questions for Your Tutor
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you help me understand what I'm doing wrong with this homework problem?
        I've tried following the example from class, but I can't make my numbers work?
        Could you read through my paper and tell me where I can improve and go more in detail?
        My professor went over this concept in class and I don't feel confident, can we go over that again?
        I'm sorry, you went too fast. Could you go over that concept again?
        How is this applied in the real world?

      <h3>About Your Tutor</h3>
      <h4>Jacob Jewitt</h4>
      <p>
        Jacob is an Accounting 301 tutor! He is a junior studying accounting. This is his first semester tutoring,
        and he thoroughly enjoys it! He became a tutor to help others overcome their struggles with intermediate 
        accounting. It's difficult, but he knows he can clarify these concepts to help others learn to enjoy accounting!
        His teaching style is mainly through examples and working through old homework assignments. As he is working
        through the old problem, he uses the real numbers in a problem to illustrate the accounting concepts need to 
        solve the problem. Working through the problem also helps him understand where the student is most struggling.
        A way you can prepare for your appointment with Jacob is to try the homework ahead of time and to think of 
        specific questions for him. Also, a little bit about him, he loves making sushi, skiing, and any kind of water 
        activities. 
      </p>
      <h4>Kimberly Landon</h4>
      <p>  
        Kimberly is an electrical engineering major, and she's been tutoring for 5 semesters! She decided to tutor 
        because some of her older siblings tutored, and they told her about the great environment of the math center.
        She is also quite good at math and wanted to learn how to communicate with other effectively. Her teaching style 
        revolves around asking a lot of questions to understand where the student is at. She seeks their input with trying
        to solve their problems. She often asks students to reexplain the concept to her to ensure they have a firm understanding. 
        Due to how extensive the math classes she tutors are, she does sometimes need a moment to remember some specific topics, 
        so she might be a little slower initially. You can be sure she knows her stuff though! She does ask that students come 
        with questions and having tried to work through the homework ahead of time. 
      </p>
      <h4>Josh Strang</h4>
      <p>
        Josh is a math major, and he loves it! This is his 4th semester tutoring, and he loves teaching math. He had
        a professor in the past that suggested he tutor due to his love of math, and he developed a love for teaching
        as well as math. He enjoys understanding the reason behind why things work, and he wanted to help others understand
        the logic behind math as well. His teaching style is very questions oriented. No question is too advanced or basic
        for him! He often works through example problems and explains the logic throughout the process. He is very patient
        and has a lot of experience with a wide variety of students. Because his appointments are based on your questions,
        it is very important to come with some questions prepared. Be ready to party! Also, a little bit about Josh, he 
        likes playing Legends of Zelda, loves studying the scriptures and making doctrine documents to explain church
        concepts. He also loves his electric scooter!
