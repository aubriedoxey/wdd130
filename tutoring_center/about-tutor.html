                <h4><strong>Jacob Jewett</strong></h4>
                <p>Jacob is an Accounting 301 tutor! He is a junior studying accounting. This is his first semester tutoring,
                    and he thoroughly enjoys it! He became a tutor to help others overcome their struggles with intermediate 
                    accounting. It's difficult, but he knows he can clarify these concepts to help others learn to enjoy accounting!
                    His teaching style is mainly through examples and working through old homework assignments. As he is working
                    through the old problem, he uses the real numbers in a problem to illustrate the accounting concepts need to 
                    solve the problem. Working through the problem also helps him understand where the student is most struggling.
                    A way you can prepare for your appointment with Jacob is to try the homework ahead of time and to think of 
                    specific questions for him. Also, a little bit about him, he loves making sushi, skiing, and any kind of water 
                    activities. </p>

                <h4><strong>Kimberly Landon</strong></h4>
                <p> Kimberly is an electrical engineering major, and she's been tutoring for 5 semesters! She decided to tutor 
                    because some of her older siblings tutored, and they told her about the great environment of the math center.
                    She is also quite good at math and wanted to learn how to communicate with other effectively. Her teaching style 
                    revolves around asking a lot of questions to understand where the student is at. She seeks their input with trying
                    to solve their problems. She often asks students to reexplain the concept to her to ensure they have a firm understanding. 
                    Due to how extensive the math classes she tutors are, she does sometimes need a moment to remember some specific topics, 
                    so she might be a little slower initially. You can be sure she knows her stuff though! She does ask that students come 
                    with questions and having tried to work through the homework ahead of time.

                <h4><strong>Josh Strang</strong></h4>
                <p> Josh is a math major, and he loves it! This is his 4th semester tutoring, and he loves teaching math. He had
                    a professor in the past that suggested he tutor due to his love of math, and he developed a love for teaching
                    as well as math. He enjoys understanding the reason behind why things work, and he wanted to help others understand
                    the logic behind math as well. His teaching style is very questions oriented. No question is too advanced or basic
                    for him! He often works through example problems and explains the logic throughout the process. He is very patient
                    and has a lot of experience with a wide variety of students. Because his appointments are based on your questions,
                    it is very important to come with some questions prepared. Be ready to party! Also, a little bit about Josh, he 
                    likes playing Legends of Zelda, loves studying the scriptures and making doctrine documents to explain church
                    concepts. He also loves his electric scooter!
