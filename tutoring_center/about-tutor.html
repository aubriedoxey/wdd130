                <h4><strong>Jacob Jewitt</strong></h4>
                <p>Jacob is an Accounting 301 tutor! He is a junior studying accounting. This is his first semester tutoring,
                    and he thoroughly enjoys it! He became a tutor to help others overcome their struggles with intermediate 
                    accounting. It's difficult, but he knows he can clarify these concepts to help others learn to enjoy accounting!
                    His teaching style is mainly through examples and working through old homework assignments. As he is working
                    through the old problem, he uses the real numbers in a problem to illustrate the accounting concepts need to 
                    solve the problem. Working through the problem also helps him understand where the student is most struggling.
                    A way you can prepare for your appointment with Jacob is to try the homework ahead of time and to think of 
                    specific questions for him. Also, a little bit about him, he loves making sushi, skiing, and any kind of water 
                    activities. </p>
