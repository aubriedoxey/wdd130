                <h4><strong>About the Tutoring Center</strong></h4>
                <p>The tutoring center is a free service provided to all students. There are both online and in person 
                    options for tutoring sessions. We are flexible to both the tutor's time as well as the student's time.
                    Here at the tutoring center we want the success of the students, so we are willing to work with 
                    students to understand old and current homework assignments, review recent topics discussed in class, 
                    and study for quizzes and tests.</p>

                    <h4>How to Prepare for Your Appointment</h4>
                    <p>
                        It is so important to come prepared to your tutoring appointment with specific questions or issues.
                        The tutors are students who have previously taken the class and done well. They are not professional
                        teachers! If you come and say, "I don't know again thing. Can you help me with everything?" That is 
                        very hard to help because it is not specific. Try to identify the most difficult issue, and work on 
                        that first. It is also very important that students go to class regularly and take notes. Tutors can 
                        only help students as much as they are willing to put forth an effort. It is also important that 
                        students make an effort to do the homework on their own before tutoring. Many students just lack 
                        confidence, so doing the work on your own can help you gain confidence.
